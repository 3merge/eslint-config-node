# ESlint Node

3merge styleguide for Node projects. Refer to [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for specifics. To configure the prettier integration, you will need to create a `.prettierrc` [file](https://gist.github.com/MikeIbberson/94369d752589251d2355abf271119c46#file-prettierrc), too. This is not portable due to conflicts with VS Code studio.
